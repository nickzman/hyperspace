// This library converts between colors defined with RGB values and HSL
// values.  It also finds in-between colors by moving linearly through
// HSL space.
// All functions take values for r, g, b, h, s, and l between 0.0 and 1.0
// (RGB = red, green, blue;  HSL = hue, saturation, luminosity)

// color while a tween value of 1.0 will output the second color.
// A value of 0 for direction indicates a positive progression around
// the color wheel (i.e. red -> yellow -> green -> cyan...).  A value of
// 1 does the opposite.
